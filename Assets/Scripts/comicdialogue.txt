Once upon a time, in the far-away mystical land of Brooklyn, New York, there was a young boy named Lazer. 
(His real name is Stan)
Lazer, from a young age, had always loved music. His mother played him Beethoven. His father played him death metal.
Eventually, Lazer realized that he wanted to make music. However, he faced one hurdle: no teacher wanted to teach him 
Because Lazer was born blind.
One day, Lazer was introduced to electronic music by his friend.
After months of practice using accessibility settings, Lazer was producing his own music! 
It was finally time to show the world that no matter what, he could overcome any hardship and be the best musician.
